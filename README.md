# Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Reviews 🎭  
### **Natural Language Processing - Text Classification**

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores **sentiment analysis** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** on the **IMDb dataset**, which consists of movie reviews labeled as **positive (1) or negative (0)**.  
The objective is to train a model that can **automatically classify** whether a given review expresses a positive or negative sentiment.  

## 🔍 **Approach**  
We implement and compare two types of **word embeddings** with different models:  

1. **TF-IDF Embedding** (Text mapped to a frequency-based vector)  
   - 📌 **Naive Mixture of Experts (MoE) Model**  
   - 📌 **Logistic Regression**  

2. **Word2Vec Embedding** (Each word mapped to a dense vector capturing meaning)  
   - 🧠 **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
   - 🔄 **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network**  

## 📊 **Results**  
🚀 (Here, add any key insights, accuracy scores, confusion matrices, or plots to make it more visually appealing!)
